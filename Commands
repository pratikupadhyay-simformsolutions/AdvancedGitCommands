1. Cherry Pick:
Cherry picking involves selecting a specific commit from one branch and applying it to another. This can be useful when you want to bring changes from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.. 
To cherry-pick a commit, we can use the command:
--  git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
Example:
=> First we ensure that we are working on the main branch.
--  $ git checkout main
=> Then we execute the cherry-pick with the following command:
-- $ git cherry-pick f
=> Once executed our Git history will look like:
a - b - c - d - f   Main
         \
           e - f - g Feature


2. Rebase:
Rebase is a way to incorporate changes from one branch onto another by moving or reapplying commits. It can help create a linear history and avoid merge commit clutter. However, it rewrites commit history, which can be problematic if shared with others.

To perform a rebase:
   git checkout feature-advanced-demo
   git rebase main

Example:
=> $ git checkout experiment
=> $ git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: added staged command


3. Stash:
Stashing allows you to temporarily save your changes without committing them. This is useful when you need to switch to a different branch for a quick fix, and you don't want to commit incomplete work.

To stash and apply changes:
   git stash
   # Do other work
   git stash apply

Example:
=> Create Stash
-- $ git stash  
"Add new files"
-- $ git stash save "Add new files"  
=> Get list of stash
-- $ git stash list  
=> Stash Appply
-- $ git stash apply '123456789'


4. Reset:
Reset moves the branch pointer to a specific commit, effectively changing the state of the branch. There are three types of reset:

    --soft: Moves the branch pointer only, keeping changes staged.
    --mixed: Moves the branch pointer and unstages changes, preserving them in the working directory.
    --hard: Moves the branch pointer, unstages changes, and discards them from the working directory.

To reset to a specific commit:
   git reset <commit-hash> --hard
Example:
-- $ git add data_acquisition.py data_preprocessing.py
-- $ git add data
-- $ git commit -m "added data acquisition and script"
-- $ git reset --soft HEAD
-- $ git add model_training.py
-- $ git commit -m "added all the python scripts"

5. Git Diff:
Git diff shows the differences between two versions of a file. You can use it to compare changes between commits, branches, or the working directory. It helps you understand what's been added, modified, or removed.

To perform Git Diff:
--  git AdvanceGitCommands.txt

Example:
-- $ diff --git a/diff_test.txt b/diff_test.txt
